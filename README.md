# Count-number-of-on-tree-fruits--Python
It is very difficult to count on tree fruits.Also manual counting of fruits take lot of time as well as labor and it may also cause damage to fruits during counting.For automatic counting I am using computer vision techniques.
For automatic detection and counting of number of on tree fruits you should requires following dependencies:
1.Python 2.7 or Python 3 version
2.OpenCv
3.Numpy
